This is a page about me.
I'm from Comber Ontario. I'm 24 years old. I enjoy travelling. I have a real love for the ocean and anything ocean related such as surfing or scuba diving. I have tried to travel to as many of the great surfing spots around the world as I can. I hopefully will continue to do so. I also enjoy creating things. I play bass in a band called The Stay At Home Dads. I have a weird knack for building furniture in my spare time. I've built things such as tables and bar stools. I am also an aircooled classic Volkswagen enthusiast. I own a 1978 Volkswagen bus.
